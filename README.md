# Application Security Portfolio

This repository hosts my **public application security portfolio website**, built as a single, lightweight HTML page and deployed via GitHub Pages.

The site is intentionally minimal and content-focused.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 🎯 Purpose of This Site

This portfolio highlights my focus on:

- Application security and authorization testing
- Business logic and access control vulnerabilities
- AWS IAM privilege escalation paths
- Security detection and risk communication
- Translating technical findings into business impact

The content reflects **real attack scenarios and defensive considerations**, not theoretical vulnerabilities.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 🧠 Design Philosophy

This site is built with the following principles:

- **Simplicity over complexity**  
  No frameworks, no build systems, no unnecessary JavaScript.

- **Signal over noise**  
  Only projects and experience relevant to application and product security are included.

- **Clarity for non-technical stakeholders**  
  Security work is framed in terms of risk and impact, not just technical findings.

- Overview of my application security focus areas
- Curated security projects with real-world context
- Professional experience relevant to security and risk analysis
